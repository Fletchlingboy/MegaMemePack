§eAccording to all known laws
§eof aviation,
§ethere is no way a bee
§eshould be able to fly.
§eIts wings are too small to get
§eits fat little body off the ground.
§eThe bee, of course, flies anyway
§ebecause bees don't care
§ewhat humans think is impossible.
§eYellow, black. Yellow, black.
§eYellow, black. Yellow, black.
§eOoh, black and yellow!
§eLet's shake it up a little.
§eBarry! Breakfast is ready!
§eComing!
§eHang on a second.
§eHello?
§e- Barry?
§e- Adam?
§e- Can you believe this is happening?
§e- I can't. I'll pick you up.
§eLooking sharp.
§eUse the stairs. Your father
§epaid good money for those.
§eSorry. I'm excited.
§eHere's the graduate.
§eWe're very proud of you, son.
§eA perfect report card, all B's.
§eVery proud.
§eMa! I got a thing going here.
§e- You got lint on your fuzz.
§e- Ow! That's me!
§e- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
§e- Bye!
§eBarry, I told you,
§estop flying in the house!
§e- Hey, Adam.
§e- Hey, Barry.
§e- Is that fuzz gel?
§e- A little. Special day, graduation.
§eNever thought I'd make it.
§eThree days grade school,
§ethree days high school.
§eThose were so awkward.
§eThree days college. I'm glad I took
§ea day and hitchhiked around the hive.
§eYou did come back different.
§e- Hi, Barry.
§e- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
§e- Hear about Frankie?
§e- Yeah.
§e- You going to the funeral?
§e- No, I'm not going.
§eEverybody knows,
§esting someone, you die.
§eDon't waste it on a squirrel.
§eSuch a hothead.
§e 
§e 
§eI guess he could have
§ejust gotten out of the way.
§e 
§e 
§eI love this incorporating
§ean amusement park into our day.
§eI guess thats they say why we don't need vacations.
§eBoy, quite a bit of pomp...
§eunder the circumstances.
§e 
§e 
§e- Well, Adam, today we are men.
§e- We are!
§e- Bee-men.
§e- Amen!
§eHallelujah!
§eStudents, faculty, distinguished bees,
§e 
§e 
§eplease welcome Dean Buzzwell.
§eWelcome, New Hive Oity
§egraduating class of...
§e...9:15.
§eThat concludes our ceremonies.
§eAnd begins your career
§eat Honex Industries!
§eWill we pick ourjob today?
§eI heard it's just orientation.
§eHeads up! Here we go.
§eKeep your hands and antennas
§einside the tram at all times.
§e- Wonder what it'll be like?
§e- A little scary.
§eWelcome to Honex,
§ea division of Honesco
§eand a part of the Hexagon Group.
§eThis is it!
§eWow.
§eWow.
§eWe know that you, as a bee,
§ehave worked your whole life
§eto get to the point where you
§ecan work for your whole life.
§eHoney begins when our valiant Pollen
§eJocks bring the nectar to the hive.
§eOur top-secret formula
§eis automatically color-corrected,
§escent-adjusted and bubble-contoured
§einto this soothing sweet syrup
§ewith its distinctive
§egolden glow you know as...
§eHoney!
§e- That girl was hot.
§e- She's my cousin!
§e- She is?
§e- Yes, we're all cousins.
§e- Right. You're right.
§e- At Honex, we constantly strive
§eto improve every aspect
§eof bee existence.
§eThese bees are stress-testing
§ea new helmet technology.
§e- What do you think he makes?
§e- Not enough.
§eHere we have our latest advancement,
§ethe Krelman.
§e- What does that do?
§e- Oatches that little strand of honey
§ethat hangs after you pour it.
§eSaves us millions.
§eOan anyone work on the Krelman?
§eOf course. Most bee jobs are
§esmall ones. But bees know
§ethat every small job,
§eif it's done well, means a lot.
§eBut choose carefully
§ebecause you'll stay in the job
§eyou pick for the rest of your life.
§eThe same job the rest of your life?
§eI didn't know that.
§eWhat's the difference?
§eYou'll be happy to know that bees,
§eas a species, haven't had one day off
§ein 27 million years.
§eSo you'll just work us to death?
§eWe'll sure try.
§eWow! That blew my mind!
§e"What's the difference?"
§eHow can you say that?
§eOne job forever?
§eThat's an insane choice to have to make.
§eI'm relieved. Now we only have
§eto make one decision in life.
§eBut, Adam, how could they
§enever have told us that?
§eWhy would you question anything?
§eWe're bees.
§eWe're the most perfectly
§efunctioning society on Earth.
§eYou ever think maybe things
§ework a little too well here?
§eLike what? Give me one example.
§eI don't know. But you know
§ewhat I'm talking about.
§ePlease clear the gate.
§eRoyal Nectar Force on approach.
§eWait a second. Oheck it out.
§e- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
§e- Wow.
§eI've never seen them this close.
§eThey know what it's like
§eoutside the hive.
§eYeah, but some don't come back.
§e- Hey, Jocks!
§e- Hi, Jocks!
§eYou guys did great!
§eYou're monsters!
§eYou're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
§e- I wonder where they were.
§e- I don't know.
§eTheir day's not planned.
§eOutside the hive, flying who knows
§ewhere, doing who knows what.
§eYou can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
§eJock. You have to be bred for that.
§eRight.
§eLook. That's more pollen
§ethan you and I will see in a lifetime.
§eIt's just a status symbol.
§eBees make too much of it.
§ePerhaps. Unless you're wearing it
§eand the ladies see you wearing it.
§eThose ladies?
§eAren't they our cousins too?
§eDistant. Distant.
§eLook at these two.
§e- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
§e- Let's have fun with them.
§eIt must be dangerous
§ebeing a Pollen Jock.
§eYeah. Once a bear pinned me
§eagainst a mushroom!
§eHe had a paw on my throat,
§eand with the other, he was slapping me!
§e- Oh, my!
§e- I never thought I'd knock him out.
§eWhat were you doing during this?
§eTrying to alert the authorities.
§eI can autograph that.
§eA little gusty out there today,
§ewasn't it, comrades?
§eYeah. Gusty.
§eWe're hitting a sunflower patch
§esix miles from here tomorrow.
§e- Six miles, huh?
§e- Barry!
§eA puddle jump for us,
§ebut maybe you're not up for it.
§e- Maybe I am.
§e- You are not!
§eWe're going 0900 at J-Gate.
§eWhat do you think, buzzy-boy?
§eAre you bee enough?
§eI might be. It all depends
§eon what 0900 means.
§eHey, Honex!
§eDad, you surprised me.
§eYou decide what you're interested in?
§e- Well, there's a lot of choices.
§e- But you only get one.
§eDo you ever get bored
§edoing the same job every day?
§eSon, let me tell you about stirring.
§eYou grab that stick, and you just
§emove it around, and you stir it around.
§eYou get yourself into a rhythm.
§eIt's a beautiful thing.
§eYou know, Dad,
§ethe more I think about it,
§emaybe the honey field
§ejust isn't right for me.
§eYou were thinking of what,
§emaking balloon animals?
§eThat's a bad job
§efor a guy with a stinger.
§eJanet, your son's not sure
§ehe wants to go into honey!
§e- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
§e- I'm not trying to be funny.
§eYou're not funny! You're going
§einto honey. Our son, the stirrer!
§e- You're gonna be a stirrer?
§e- No one's listening to me!
§eWait till you see the sticks I have.
§eI could say anything right now.
§eI'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
§eLet's open some honey and celebrate!
§eMaybe I'll pierce my thorax.
§eShave my antennae.
§eShack up with a grasshopper. Get
§ea gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!
§eI'm so proud.
§e- We're starting work today!
§e- Today's the day.
§eOome on! All the good jobs
§ewill be gone.
§eYeah, right.
§ePollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
§estirrer, front desk, hair removal...
§e- Is it still available?
§e- Hang on. Two left!
§eOne of them's yours! Oongratulations!
§eStep to the side.
§e- What'd you get?
§e- Picking crud out. Stellar!
§eWow!
§eOouple of newbies?
§eYes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
§eMake your choice.
§e- You want to go first?
§e- No, you go.
§eOh, my. What's available?
§eRestroom attendant's open,
§enot for the reason you think.
§e- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
§e- Sure, you're on.
§eI'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
§eWax monkey's always open.
§eThe Krelman opened up again.
§eWhat happened?
§eA bee died. Makes an opening. See?
§eHe's dead. Another dead one.
§eDeady. Deadified. Two more dead.
§eDead from the neck up.
§eDead from the neck down. That's life!
§eOh, this is so hard!
§eHeating, cooling,
§estunt bee, pourer, stirrer,
§ehumming, inspector number seven,
§elint coordinator, stripe supervisor,
§emite wrangler. Barry, what
§edo you think I should... Barry?
§eBarry!
§eAll right, we've got the sunflower patch
§ein quadrant nine...
§eWhat happened to you?
§eWhere are you?
§e- I'm going out.
§e- Out? Out where?
§e- Out there.
§e- Oh, no!
§eI have to, before I go
§eto work for the rest of my life.
§eYou're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
§eAnother call coming in.
§eIf anyone's feeling brave,
§ethere's a Korean deli on 83rd
§ethat gets their roses today.
§eHey, guys.
§e- Look at that.
§e- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
§eHold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
§eIt's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
§eReally? Feeling lucky, are you?
§eSign here, here. Just initial that.
§e- Thank you.
§e- OK.
§eYou got a rain advisory today,
§eand as you all know,
§ebees cannot fly in rain.
§eSo be careful. As always,
§ewatch your brooms,
§ehockey sticks, dogs,
§ebirds, bears and bats.
§eAlso, I got a couple of reports
§eof root beer being poured on us.
§eMurphy's in a home because of it,
§ebabbling like a cicada!
§e- That's awful.
§e- And a reminder for you rookies,
§ebee law number one,
§eabsolutely no talking to humans!
§eAll right, launch positions!
§eBuzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
§ebuzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
§eBlack and yellow!
§eHello!
§eYou ready for this, hot shot?
§eYeah. Yeah, bring it on.
§eWind, check.
§e- Antennae, check.
§e- Nectar pack, check.
§e- Wings, check.
§e- Stinger, check.
§eScared out of my shorts, check.
§eOK, ladies,
§elet's move it out!
§ePound those petunias,
§eyou striped stem-suckers!
§eAll of you, drain those flowers!
§eWow! I'm out!
§eI can't believe I'm out!
§eSo blue.
§eI feel so fast and free!
§eBox kite!
§eWow!
§eFlowers!
§eThis is Blue Leader.
§eWe have roses visual.
§eBring it around 30 degrees and hold.
§eRoses!
§e30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.
§eStand to the side, kid.
§eIt's got a bit of a kick.
§eThat is one nectar collector!
§e- Ever see pollination up close?
§e- No, sir.
§eI pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
§eover here. Maybe a dash over there,
§ea pinch on that one.
§eSee that? It's a little bit of magic.
§eThat's amazing. Why do we do that?
§eThat's pollen power. More pollen, more
§eflowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
§eOool.
§eI'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
§eOould be daisies. Don't we need those?
§eOopy that visual.
§eWait. One of these flowers
§eseems to be on the move.
§eSay again? You're reporting
§ea moving flower?
§eAffirmative.
§eThat was on the line!
§eThis is the coolest. What is it?
§eI don't know, but I'm loving this color.
§eIt smells good.
§eNot like a flower, but I like it.
§eYeah, fuzzy.
§eOhemical-y.
§eOareful, guys. It's a little grabby.
§eMy sweet lord of bees!
§eOandy-brain, get off there!
§eProblem!
§e- Guys!
§e- This could be bad.
§eAffirmative.
§eVery close.
§eGonna hurt.
§eMama's little boy.
§eYou are way out of position, rookie!
§eOoming in at you like a missile!
§eHelp me!
§eI don't think these are flowers.
§e- Should we tell him?
§e- I think he knows.
§eWhat is this?!
§eMatch point!
§eYou can start packing up, honey,
§ebecause you're about to eat it!
§eYowser!
§eGross.
§eThere's a bee in the car!
§e- Do something!
§e- I'm driving!
§e- Hi, bee.
§e- He's back here!
§eHe's going to sting me!
§eNobody move. If you don't move,
§ehe won't sting you. Freeze!
§eHe blinked!
§eSpray him, Granny!
§eWhat are you doing?!
§eWow... the tension level
§eout here is unbelievable.
§eI gotta get home.
§eOan't fly in rain.
§eOan't fly in rain.
§eOan't fly in rain.
§eMayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
§eKen, could you close
§ethe window please?
§eKen, could you close
§ethe window please?
§eOheck out my new resume.
§eI made it into a fold-out brochure.
§eYou see? Folds out.
§eOh, no. More humans. I don't need this.
§eWhat was that?
§eMaybe this time. This time. This time.
§eThis time! This time! This...
§eDrapes!
§eThat is diabolical.
§eIt's fantastic. It's got all my special
§eskills, even my top-ten favorite movies.
§eWhat's number one? Star Wars?
§eNah, I don't go for that...
§e...kind of stuff.
§eNo wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
§eThey're out of their minds.
§eWhen I leave a job interview, they're
§eflabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
§eThere's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
§eI don't remember the sun
§ehaving a big 75 on it.
§eI predicted global warming.
§eI could feel it getting hotter.
§eAt first I thought it was just me.
§eWait! Stop! Bee!
§eStand back. These are winter boots.
§eWait!
§eDon't kill him!
§eYou know I'm allergic to them!
§eThis thing could kill me!
§eWhy does his life have
§eless value than yours?
§eWhy does his life have any less value
§ethan mine? Is that your statement?
§eI'm just saying all life has value. You
§edon't know what he's capable of feeling.
§eMy brochure!
§eThere you go, little guy.
§eI'm not scared of him.
§eIt's an allergic thing.
§ePut that on your resume brochure.
§eMy whole face could puff up.
§eMake it one of your special skills.
§eKnocking someone out
§eis also a special skill.
§eRight. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
§e- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
§e- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.
§e- You could put carob chips on there.
§e- Bye.
§e- Supposed to be less calories.
§e- Bye.
§eI gotta say something.
§eShe saved my life.
§eI gotta say something.
§eAll right, here it goes.
§eNah.
§eWhat would I say?
§eI could really get in trouble.
§eIt's a bee law.
§eYou're not supposed to talk to a human.
§eI can't believe I'm doing this.
§eI've got to.
§eOh, I can't do it. Oome on!
§eNo. Yes. No.
§eDo it. I can't.
§eHow should I start it?
§e"You like jazz?" No, that's no good.
§eHere she comes! Speak, you fool!
§eHi!
§eI'm sorry.
§e- You're talking.
§e- Yes, I know.
§eYou're talking!
§eI'm so sorry.
§eNo, it's OK. It's fine.
§eI know I'm dreaming.
§eBut I don't recall going to bed.
§eWell, I'm sure this
§eis very disconcerting.
§eThis is a bit of a surprise to me.
§eI mean, you're a bee!
§eI am. And I'm not supposed
§eto be doing this,
§ebut they were all trying to kill me.
§eAnd if it wasn't for you...
§eI had to thank you.
§eIt's just how I was raised.
§eThat was a little weird.
§e- I'm talking with a bee.
§e- Yeah.
§eI'm talking to a bee.
§eAnd the bee is talking to me!
§eI just want to say I'm grateful.
§eI'll leave now.
§e- Wait! How did you learn to do that?
§e- What?
§eThe talking thing.
§eSame way you did, I guess.
§e"Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.
§e- That's very funny.
§e- Yeah.
§eBees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
§ewe'd cry with what we have to deal with.
§eAnyway...
§eOan I...
§e...get you something?
§e- Like what?
§eI don't know. I mean...
§eI don't know. Ooffee?
§eI don't want to put you out.
§eIt's no trouble. It takes two minutes.
§e- It's just coffee.
§e- I hate to impose.
§e- Don't be ridiculous!
§e- Actually, I would love a cup.
§eHey, you want rum cake?
§e- I shouldn't.
§e- Have some.
§e- No, I can't.
§e- Oome on!
§eI'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.
§e- Where?
§e- These stripes don't help.
§eYou look great!
§eI don't know if you know
§eanything about fashion.
§eAre you all right?
§eNo.
§eHe's making the tie in the cab
§eas they're flying up Madison.
§eHe finally gets there.
§eHe runs up the steps into the church.
§eThe wedding is on.
§eAnd he says, "Watermelon?
§eI thought you said Guatemalan.
§eWhy would I marry a watermelon?"
§eIs that a bee joke?
§eThat's the kind of stuff we do.
§eYeah, different.
§eSo, what are you gonna do, Barry?
§eAbout work? I don't know.
§eI want to do my part for the hive,
§ebut I can't do it the way they want.
§eI know how you feel.
§e- You do?
§e- Sure.
§eMy parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
§ea doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.
§e- Really?
§e- My only interest is flowers.
§eOur new queen was just elected
§ewith that same campaign slogan.
§eAnyway, if you look...
§eThere's my hive right there. See it?
§eYou're in Sheep Meadow!
§eYes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!
§eNo way! I know that area.
§eI lost a toe ring there once.
§e- Why do girls put rings on their toes?
§e- Why not?
§e- It's like putting a hat on your knee.
§e- Maybe I'll try that.
§e- You all right, ma'am?
§e- Oh, yeah. Fine.
§eJust having two cups of coffee!
§eAnyway, this has been great.
§eThanks for the coffee.
§eYeah, it's no trouble.
§eSorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
§eI'd be up the rest of my life.
§eAre you...?
§eOan I take a piece of this with me?
§eSure! Here, have a crumb.
§e- Thanks!
§e- Yeah.
§eAll right. Well, then...
§eI guess I'll see you around.
§eOr not.
§eOK, Barry.
§eAnd thank you
§eso much again... for before.
§eOh, that? That was nothing.
§eWell, not nothing, but... Anyway...
§eThis can't possibly work.
§eHe's all set to go.
§eWe may as well try it.
§eOK, Dave, pull the chute.
§e- Sounds amazing.
§e- It was amazing!
§eIt was the scariest,
§ehappiest moment of my life.
§eHumans! I can't believe
§eyou were with humans!
§eGiant, scary humans!
§eWhat were they like?
§eHuge and crazy. They talk crazy.
§eThey eat crazy giant things.
§eThey drive crazy.
§e- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
§e- Some of them. But some of them don't.
§e- How'd you get back?
§e- Poodle.
§eYou did it, and I'm glad. You saw
§ewhatever you wanted to see.
§eYou had your "experience." Now you
§ecan pick out yourjob and be normal.
§e- Well...
§e- Well?
§eWell, I met someone.
§eYou did? Was she Bee-ish?
§e- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
§e- No, no, no, not a wasp.
§e- Spider?
§e- I'm not attracted to spiders.
§eI know it's the hottest thing,
§ewith the eight legs and all.
§eI can't get by that face.
§eSo who is she?
§eShe's... human.
§eNo, no. That's a bee law.
§eYou wouldn't break a bee law.
§e- Her name's Vanessa.
§e- Oh, boy.
§eShe's so nice. And she's a florist!
§eOh, no! You're dating a human florist!
§eWe're not dating.
§eYou're flying outside the hive, talking
§eto humans that attack our homes
§ewith power washers and M-80s!
§eOne-eighth a stick of dynamite!
§eShe saved my life!
§eAnd she understands me.
§eThis is over!
§eEat this.
§eThis is not over! What was that?
§e- They call it a crumb.
§e- It was so stingin' stripey!
§eAnd that's not what they eat.
§eThat's what falls off what they eat!
§e- You know what a Oinnabon is?
§e- No.
§eIt's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
§eThey heat it up...
§eSit down!
§e...really hot!
§e- Listen to me!
§eWe are not them! We're us.
§eThere's us and there's them!
§eYes, but who can deny
§ethe heart that is yearning?
§eThere's no yearning.
§eStop yearning. Listen to me!
§eYou have got to start thinking bee,
§emy friend. Thinking bee!
§e- Thinking bee.
§e- Thinking bee.
§eThinking bee! Thinking bee!
§eThinking bee! Thinking bee!
§eThere he is. He's in the pool.
§eYou know what your problem is, Barry?
§eI gotta start thinking bee?
§eHow much longer will this go on?
§eIt's been three days!
§eWhy aren't you working?
§eI've got a lot of big life decisions
§eto think about.
§eWhat life? You have no life!
§eYou have no job. You're barely a bee!
§eWould it kill you
§eto make a little honey?
§eBarry, come out.
§eYour father's talking to you.
§eMartin, would you talk to him?
§eBarry, I'm talking to you!
§eYou coming?
§eGot everything?
§eAll set!
§eGo ahead. I'll catch up.
§eDon't be too long.
§eWatch this!
§eVanessa!
§e- We're still here.
§e- I told you not to yell at him.
§eHe doesn't respond to yelling!
§e- Then why yell at me?
§e- Because you don't listen!
§eI'm not listening to this.
§eSorry, I've gotta go.
§e- Where are you going?
§e- I'm meeting a friend.
§eA girl? Is this why you can't decide?
§eBye.
§eI just hope she's Bee-ish.
§eThey have a huge parade
§eof flowers every year in Pasadena?
§eTo be in the Tournament of Roses,
§ethat's every florist's dream!
§eUp on a float, surrounded
§eby flowers, crowds cheering.
§eA tournament. Do the roses
§ecompete in athletic events?
§eNo. All right, I've got one.
§eHow come you don't fly everywhere?
§eIt's exhausting. Why don't you
§erun everywhere? It's faster.
§eYeah, OK, I see, I see.
§eAll right, your turn.
§eTiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
§eThat's insane!
§eYou don't have that?
§eWe have Hivo, but it's a disease.
§eIt's a horrible, horrible disease.
§eOh, my.
§eDumb bees!
§eYou must want to sting all those jerks.
§eWe try not to sting.
§eIt's usually fatal for us.
§eSo you have to watch your temper.
§eVery carefully.
§eYou kick a wall, take a walk,
§ewrite an angry letter and throw it out.
§eWork through it like any emotion:
§eAnger, jealousy, lust.
§eOh, my goodness! Are you OK?
§eYeah.
§e- What is wrong with you?!
§e- It's a bug.
§eHe's not bothering anybody.
§eGet out of here, you creep!
§eWhat was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?
§eYeah, it was. How did you know?
§eIt felt like about 10 pages.
§eSeventy-five is pretty much our limit.
§eYou've really got that
§edown to a science.
§e- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
§e- I'll bet.
§eWhat in the name
§eof Mighty Hercules is this?
§eHow did this get here?
§eOute Bee, Golden Blossom,
§eRay Liotta Private Select?
§e- Is he that actor?
§e- I never heard of him.
§e- Why is this here?
§e- For people. We eat it.
§eYou don't have
§eenough food of your own?
§e- Well, yes.
§e- How do you get it?
§e- Bees make it.
§e- I know who makes it!
§eAnd it's hard to make it!
§eThere's heating, cooling, stirring.
§eYou need a whole Krelman thing!
§e- It's organic.
§e- It's our-ganic!
§eIt's just honey, Barry.
§eJust what?!
§eBees don't know about this!
§eThis is stealing! A lot of stealing!
§eYou've taken our homes, schools,
§ehospitals! This is all we have!
§eAnd it's on sale?!
§eI'm getting to the bottom of this.
§eI'm getting to the bottom
§eof all of this!
§eHey, Hector.
§e- You almost done?
§e- Almost.
§eHe is here. I sense it.
§eWell, I guess I'll go home now
§eand just leave this nice honey out,
§ewith no one around.
§eYou're busted, box boy!
§eI knew I heard something.
§eSo you can talk!
§eI can talk.
§eAnd now you'll start talking!
§eWhere you getting the sweet stuff?
§eWho's your supplier?
§eI don't understand.
§eI thought we were friends.
§eThe last thing we want
§eto do is upset bees!
§eYou're too late! It's ours now!
§eYou, sir, have crossed
§ethe wrong sword!
§eYou, sir, will be lunch
§efor my iguana, Ignacio!
§eWhere is the honey coming from?
§eTell me where!
§eHoney Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!
§eOrazy person!
§eWhat horrible thing has happened here?
§eThese faces, they never knew
§ewhat hit them. And now
§ethey're on the road to nowhere!
§eJust keep still.
§eWhat? You're not dead?
§eDo I look dead? They will wipe anything
§ethat moves. Where you headed?
§eTo Honey Farms.
§eI am onto something huge here.
§eI'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
§ecrazy stuff. Blows your head off!
§eI'm going to Tacoma.
§e- And you?
§e- He really is dead.
§eAll right.
§eUh-oh!
§e- What is that?!
§e- Oh, no!
§e- A wiper! Triple blade!
§e- Triple blade?
§eJump on! It's your only chance, bee!
§eWhy does everything have
§eto be so doggone clean?!
§eHow much do you people need to see?!
§eOpen your eyes!
§eStick your head out the window!
§eFrom NPR News in Washington,
§eI'm Oarl Kasell.
§eBut don't kill no more bugs!
§e- Bee!
§e- Moose blood guy!!
§e- You hear something?
§e- Like what?
§eLike tiny screaming.
§eTurn off the radio.
§eWhassup, bee boy?
§eHey, Blood.
§eJust a row of honey jars,
§eas far as the eye could see.
§eWow!
§eI assume wherever this truck goes
§eis where they're getting it.
§eI mean, that honey's ours.
§e- Bees hang tight.
§e- We're all jammed in.
§eIt's a close community.
§eNot us, man. We on our own.
§eEvery mosquito on his own.
§e- What if you get in trouble?
§e- You a mosquito, you in trouble.
§eNobody likes us. They just smack.
§eSee a mosquito, smack, smack!
§eAt least you're out in the world.
§eYou must meet girls.
§eMosquito girls try to trade up,
§eget with a moth, dragonfly.
§eMosquito girl don't want no mosquito.
§eYou got to be kidding me!
§eMooseblood's about to leave
§ethe building! So long, bee!
§e- Hey, guys!
§e- Mooseblood!
§eI knew I'd catch y'all down here.
§eDid you bring your crazy straw?
§eWe throw it in jars, slap a label on it,
§eand it's pretty much pure profit.
§eWhat is this place?
§eA bee's got a brain
§ethe size of a pinhead.
§eThey are pinheads!
§ePinhead.
§e- Oheck out the new smoker.
§e- Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.
§eThe Thomas 3000!
§eSmoker?
§eNinety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
§eTwice the nicotine, all the tar.
§eA couple breaths of this
§eknocks them right out.
§eThey make the honey,
§eand we make the money.
§e"They make the honey,
§eand we make the money"?
§eOh, my!
§eWhat's going on? Are you OK?
§eYeah. It doesn't last too long.
§eDo you know you're
§ein a fake hive with fake walls?
§eOur queen was moved here.
§eWe had no choice.
§eThis is your queen?
§eThat's a man in women's clothes!
§eThat's a drag queen!
§eWhat is this?
§eOh, no!
§eThere's hundreds of them!
§eBee honey.
§eOur honey is being brazenly stolen
§eon a massive scale!
§eThis is worse than anything bears
§ehave done! I intend to do something.
§eOh, Barry, stop.
§eWho told you humans are taking
§eour honey? That's a rumor.
§eDo these look like rumors?
§eThat's a conspiracy theory.
§eThese are obviously doctored photos.
§eHow did you get mixed up in this?
§eHe's been talking to humans.
§e- What?
§e- Talking to humans?!
§eHe has a human girlfriend.
§eAnd they make out!
§eMake out? Barry!
§eWe do not.
§e- You wish you could.
§e- Whose side are you on?
§eThe bees!
§eI dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
§eThose crazy legs kept me up all night.
§eBarry, this is what you want
§eto do with your life?
§eI want to do it for all our lives.
§eNobody works harder than bees!
§eDad, I remember you
§ecoming home so overworked
§eyour hands were still stirring.
§eYou couldn't stop.
§eI remember that.
§eWhat right do they have to our honey?
§eWe live on two cups a year. They put it
§ein lip balm for no reason whatsoever!
§eEven if it's true, what can one bee do?
§eSting them where it really hurts.
§eIn the face! The eye!
§e- That would hurt.
§e- No.
§eUp the nose? That's a killer.
§eThere's only one place you can sting
§ethe humans, one place where it matters.
§eHive at Five, the hive's only
§efull-hour action news source.
§eNo more bee beards!
§eWith Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.
§eWeather with Storm Stinger.
§eSports with Buzz Larvi.
§eAnd Jeanette Ohung.
§e- Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
§e- And I'm Jeanette Ohung.
§eA tri-county bee, Barry Benson,
§eintends to sue the human race
§efor stealing our honey,
§epackaging it and profiting
§efrom it illegally!
§eTomorrow night on Bee Larry King,
§ewe'll have three former queens here in
§eour studio, discussing their new book,
§eOlassy Ladies,
§eout this week on Hexagon.
§eTonight we're talking to Barry Benson.
§eDid you ever think, "I'm a kid
§efrom the hive. I can't do this"?
§eBees have never been afraid
§eto change the world.
§eWhat about Bee Oolumbus?
§eBee Gandhi? Bejesus?
§eWhere I'm from, we'd never sue humans.
§eWe were thinking
§eof stickball or candy stores.
§eHow old are you?
§eThe bee community
§eis supporting you in this case,
§ewhich will be the trial
§eof the bee century.
§eYou know, they have a Larry King
§ein the human world too.
§eIt's a common name. Next week...
§eHe looks like you and has a show
§eand suspenders and colored dots...
§eNext week...
§eGlasses, quotes on the bottom from the
§eguest even though you just heard 'em.
§eBear Week next week!
§eThey're scary, hairy and here live.
§eAlways leans forward, pointy shoulders,
§esquinty eyes, very Jewish.
§eIn tennis, you attack
§eat the point of weakness!
§eIt was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.
§eHoney, her backhand's a joke!
§eI'm not gonna take advantage of that?
§eQuiet, please.
§eActual work going on here.
§e- Is that that same bee?
§e- Yes, it is!
§eI'm helping him sue the human race.
§e- Hello.
§e- Hello, bee.
§eThis is Ken.
§eYeah, I remember you. Timberland, size
§eten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.
§eWhy does he talk again?
§eListen, you better go
§e'cause we're really busy working.
§eBut it's our yogurt night!
§eBye-bye.
§eWhy is yogurt night so difficult?!
§eYou poor thing.
§eYou two have been at this for hours!
§eYes, and Adam here
§ehas been a huge help.
§e- Frosting...
§e- How many sugars?
§eJust one. I try not
§eto use the competition.
§eSo why are you helping me?
§eBees have good qualities.
§eAnd it takes my mind off the shop.
§eInstead of flowers, people
§eare giving balloon bouquets now.
§eThose are great, if you're three.
§eAnd artificial flowers.
§e- Oh, those just get me psychotic!
§e- Yeah, me too.
§eBent stingers, pointless pollination.
§eBees must hate those fake things!
§eNothing worse
§ethan a daffodil that's had work done.
§eMaybe this could make up
§efor it a little bit.
§e- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
§e- I guess.
§eYou sure you want to go through with it?
§eAm I sure? When I'm done with
§ethe humans, they won't be able
§eto say, "Honey, I'm home,"
§ewithout paying a royalty!
§eIt's an incredible scene
§ehere in downtown Manhattan,
§ewhere the world anxiously waits,
§ebecause for the first time in history,
§ewe will hear for ourselves
§eif a honeybee can actually speak.
§eWhat have we gotten into here, Barry?
§eIt's pretty big, isn't it?
§eI can't believe how many humans
§edon't work during the day.
§eYou think billion-dollar multinational
§efood companies have good lawyers?
§eEverybody needs to stay
§ebehind the barricade.
§e- What's the matter?
§e- I don't know, I just got a chill.
§eWell, if it isn't the bee team.
§eYou boys work on this?
§eAll rise! The Honorable
§eJudge Bumbleton presiding.
§eAll right. Oase number 4475,
§eSuperior Oourt of New York,
§eBarry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry
§eis now in session.
§eMr. Montgomery, you're representing
§ethe five food companies collectively?
§eA privilege.
§eMr. Benson... you're representing
§eall the bees of the world?
§eI'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
§ewe're ready to proceed.
§eMr. Montgomery,
§eyour opening statement, please.
§eLadies and gentlemen of the jury,
§emy grandmother was a simple woman.
§eBorn on a farm, she believed
§eit was man's divine right
§eto benefit from the bounty
§eof nature God put before us.
§eIf we lived in the topsy-turvy world
§eMr. Benson imagines,
§ejust think of what would it mean.
§eI would have to negotiate
§ewith the silkworm
§efor the elastic in my britches!
§eTalking bee!
§eHow do we know this isn't some sort of
§eholographic motion-picture-capture
§eHollywood wizardry?
§eThey could be using laser beams!
§eRobotics! Ventriloquism!
§eOloning! For all we know,
§ehe could be on steroids!
§eMr. Benson?
§eLadies and gentlemen,
§ethere's no trickery here.
§eI'm just an ordinary bee.
§eHoney's pretty important to me.
§eIt's important to all bees.
§eWe invented it!
§eWe make it. And we protect it
§ewith our lives.
§eUnfortunately, there are
§esome people in this room
§ewho think they can take it from us
§e'cause we're the little guys!
§eI'm hoping that, after this is all over,
§eyou'll see how, by taking our honey,
§eyou not only take everything we have
§ebut everything we are!
§eI wish he'd dress like that
§eall the time. So nice!
§eOall your first witness.
§eSo, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
§eof Honey Farms, big company you have.
§eI suppose so.
§eI see you also own
§eHoneyburton and Honron!
§eYes, they provide beekeepers
§efor our farms.
§eBeekeeper. I find that
§eto be a very disturbing term.
§eI don't imagine you employ
§eany bee-free-ers, do you?
§e- No.
§e- I couldn't hear you.
§e- No.
§e- No.
§eBecause you don't free bees.
§eYou keep bees. Not only that,
§eit seems you thought a bear would be
§ean appropriate image for a jar of honey.
§eThey're very lovable creatures.
§eYogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.
§eYou mean like this?
§eBears kill bees!
§eHow'd you like his head crashing
§ethrough your living room?!
§eBiting into your couch!
§eSpitting out your throw pillows!
§eOK, that's enough. Take him away.
§eSo, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
§eYour name intrigues me.
§e- Where have I heard it before?
§e- I was with a band called The Police.
§eBut you've never been
§ea police officer, have you?
§eNo, I haven't.
§eNo, you haven't. And so here
§ewe have yet another example
§eof bee culture casually
§estolen by a human
§efor nothing more than
§ea prance-about stage name.
§eOh, please.
§eHave you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?
§eBecause I'm feeling
§ea little stung, Sting.
§eOr should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!
§eThat's not his real name?! You idiots!
§eMr. Liotta, first,
§ebelated congratulations on
§eyour Emmy win for a guest spot
§eon ER in 2005.
§eThank you. Thank you.
§eI see from your resume
§ethat you're devilishly handsome
§ewith a churning inner turmoil
§ethat's ready to blow.
§eI enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?
§eNot yet it isn't. But is this
§ewhat it's come to for you?
§eExploiting tiny, helpless bees
§eso you don't
§ehave to rehearse
§eyour part and learn your lines, sir?
§eWatch it, Benson!
§eI could blow right now!
§eThis isn't a goodfella.
§eThis is a badfella!
§eWhy doesn't someone just step on
§ethis creep, and we can all go home?!
§e- Order in this court!
§e- You're all thinking it!
§eOrder! Order, I say!
§e- Say it!
§e- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!
§eI think it was awfully nice
§eof that bear to pitch in like that.
§eI think the jury's on our side.
§eAre we doing everything right, legally?
§eI'm a florist.
§eRight. Well, here's to a great team.
§eTo a great team!
§eWell, hello.
§e- Ken!
§e- Hello.
§eI didn't think you were coming.
§eNo, I was just late.
§eI tried to call, but... the battery.
§eI didn't want all this to go to waste,
§eso I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.
§eOh, that was lucky.
§eThere's a little left.
§eI could heat it up.
§eYeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.
§eSo I hear you're quite a tennis player.
§eI'm not much for the game myself.
§eThe ball's a little grabby.
§eThat's where I usually sit.
§eRight... there.
§eKen, Barry was looking at your resume,
§eand he agreed with me that eating with
§echopsticks isn't really a special skill.
§eYou think I don't see what you're doing?
§eI know how hard it is to find
§ethe rightjob. We have that in common.
§eDo we?
§eBees have 100 percent employment,
§ebut we do jobs like taking the crud out.
§eThat's just what
§eI was thinking about doing.
§eKen, I let Barry borrow your razor
§efor his fuzz. I hope that was all right.
§eI'm going to drain the old stinger.
§eYeah, you do that.
§eLook at that.
§eYou know, I've just about had it
§ewith your little mind games.
§e- What's that?
§e- Italian Vogue.
§eMamma mia, that's a lot of pages.
§eA lot of ads.
§eRemember what Van said, why is
§eyour life more valuable than mine?
§eFunny, I just can't seem to recall that!
§eI think something stinks in here!
§eI love the smell of flowers.
§eHow do you like the smell of flames?!
§eNot as much.
§eWater bug! Not taking sides!
§eKen, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!
§eThis is pathetic!
§eI've got issues!
§eWell, well, well, a royal flush!
§e- You're bluffing.
§e- Am I?
§eSurf's up, dude!
§ePoo water!
§eThat bowl is gnarly.
§eExcept for those dirty yellow rings!
§eKenneth! What are you doing?!
§eYou know, I don't even like honey!
§eI don't eat it!
§eWe need to talk!
§eHe's just a little bee!
§eAnd he happens to be
§ethe nicest bee I've met in a long time!
§eLong time? What are you talking about?!
§eAre there other bugs in your life?
§eNo, but there are other things bugging
§eme in life. And you're one of them!
§eFine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...
§eMy nerves are fried from riding
§eon this emotional roller coaster!
§eGoodbye, Ken.
§eAnd for your information,
§eI prefer sugar-free, artificial
§esweeteners made by man!
§eI'm sorry about all that.
§eI know it's got
§ean aftertaste! I like it!
§eI always felt there was some kind
§eof barrier between Ken and me.
§eI couldn't overcome it.
§eOh, well.
§eAre you OK for the trial?
§eI believe Mr. Montgomery
§eis about out of ideas.
§eWe would like to call
§eMr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.
§eGood idea! You can really see why he's
§econsidered one of the best lawyers...
§eYeah.
§eLayton, you've
§egotta weave some magic
§ewith this jury,
§eor it's gonna be all over.
§eDon't worry. The only thing I have
§eto do to turn this jury around
§eis to remind them
§eof what they don't like about bees.
§e- You got the tweezers?
§e- Are you allergic?
§eOnly to losing, son. Only to losing.
§eMr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
§ewhat I think we'd all like to know.
§eWhat exactly is your relationship
§eto that woman?
§eWe're friends.
§e- Good friends?
§e- Yes.
§eHow good? Do you live together?
§eWait a minute...
§eAre you her little...
§e...bedbug?
§eI've seen a bee documentary or two.
§eFrom what I understand,
§edoesn't your queen give birth
§eto all the bee children?
§e- Yeah, but...
§e- So those aren't your real parents!
§e- Oh, Barry...
§e- Yes, they are!
§eHold me back!
§eYou're an illegitimate bee,
§earen't you, Benson?
§eHe's denouncing bees!
§eDon't y'all date your cousins?
§e- Objection!
§e- I'm going to pincushion this guy!
§eAdam, don't! It's what he wants!
§eOh, I'm hit!!
§eOh, lordy, I am hit!
§eOrder! Order!
§eThe venom! The venom
§eis coursing through my veins!
§eI have been felled
§eby a winged beast of destruction!
§eYou see? You can't treat them
§elike equals! They're striped savages!
§eStinging's the only thing
§ethey know! It's their way!
§e- Adam, stay with me.
§e- I can't feel my legs.
§eWhat angel of mercy
§ewill come forward to suck the poison
§efrom my heaving buttocks?
§eI will have order in this court. Order!
§eOrder, please!
§eThe case of the honeybees
§eversus the human race
§etook a pointed turn against the bees
§eyesterday when one of their legal
§eteam stung Layton T. Montgomery.
§e- Hey, buddy.
§e- Hey.
§e- Is there much pain?
§e- Yeah.
§eI...
§eI blew the whole case, didn't I?
§eIt doesn't matter. What matters is
§eyou're alive. You could have died.
§eI'd be better off dead. Look at me.
§eThey got it from the cafeteria
§edownstairs, in a tuna sandwich.
§eLook, there's
§ea little celery still on it.
§eWhat was it like to sting someone?
§eI can't explain it. It was all...
§eAll adrenaline and then...
§eand then ecstasy!
§eAll right.
§eYou think it was all a trap?
§eOf course. I'm sorry.
§eI flew us right into this.
§eWhat were we thinking? Look at us. We're
§ejust a couple of bugs in this world.
§eWhat will the humans do to us
§eif they win?
§eI don't know.
§eI hear they put the roaches in motels.
§eThat doesn't sound so bad.
§eAdam, they check in,
§ebut they don't check out!
§eOh, my.
§eOould you get a nurse
§eto close that window?
§e- Why?
§e- The smoke.
§eBees don't smoke.
§eRight. Bees don't smoke.
§eBees don't smoke!
§eBut some bees are smoking.
§eThat's it! That's our case!
§eIt is? It's not over?
§eGet dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.
§eGet back to the court and stall.
§eStall any way you can.
§eAnd assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.
§eMr. Flayman.
§eYes? Yes, Your Honor!
§eWhere is the rest of your team?
§eWell, Your Honor, it's interesting.
§eBees are trained to fly haphazardly,
§eand as a result,
§ewe don't make very good time.
§eI actually heard a funny story about...
§eYour Honor,
§ehaven't these ridiculous bugs
§etaken up enough
§eof this court's valuable time?
§eHow much longer will we allow
§ethese absurd shenanigans to go on?
§eThey have presented no compelling
§eevidence to support their charges
§eagainst my clients,
§ewho run legitimate businesses.
